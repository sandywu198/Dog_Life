# Dog_Life

Submitted by: Sandy Wu

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Summary

Dog Life is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **Change or add to this description**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòëüò£
